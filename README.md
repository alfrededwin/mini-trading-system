# Mini Trading System
Distributed Systems CW02 -  In this assignment you are expected to design and build mini trading systems.

Stock trading systems involve processing orders placed by traders for different stocks registered with the system. A trader can express their intention to sell stocks by placing a sell order, and another trader can buy or express the intention to buy a certain stock by placing a buy order. Orders are kept in an order book until a match is made, and If the prices match the orders are executed and a trade takes place. 
Furthermore, traders can delete or edit their existing un-executed orders that are sitting in the orderbook. An order consists of the symbol of the stock, quantity of the stocks and the price the trader intends to buy or sell and the order type to indicate if itâ€™s a buy order or a sell order.
Stock trading systems are expected to be highly available and scalable. Also, accuracy is critical for stock trading systems as it deals with money. In this assignment you are expected to design and build mini trading systems.
